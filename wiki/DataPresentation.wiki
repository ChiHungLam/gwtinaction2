= Chapter 10 Data Presentation Widgets =

This is a comprehensive chapter that covers all aspects of GWT's Data Presentation (Cell) widgets including GWT 2.5 functionality.

The aim is to arrive at a widget such as the following:

http://gwtinaction2.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/ch10/cellwidgets.png

which shows custom building of inserted rows on events in the grid, data retrieved from asynchronous server calls, sorting and a variety of cells, together with a pager.

To get there the chapter goes through a number of steps such as investigating existing cell types and how to build new ones (including 2.5's UiBinder capability for cells).

We look at how to retrieve data from Lists, and more importantly discuss how to use more real-life asynchronous connections.

Each of the exsting data presentation widgets are looked at: CellList, CellTree/Browser, CellTable and DataGrid.  With each one we cover the main points in a practical manner such as paging, sorting, creating realistic TreeViewModels from server data as well as how to custom build CellTable and DataGrid rows so that you can have the experience of expanding rows holding "hidden" until required data.

No where else is all this content covered in so much detail, and quite often it is missing altogether in other sources.
