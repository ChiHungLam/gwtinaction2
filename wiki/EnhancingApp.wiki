== Looking at.. ==

 * Widgets (new and wrapping existing HTML)
 * Panels
 * !RootPanels
 * DOM Manipulation to get data from HTML page
 * Events and handling
 * History Management
 * Styling (programmatically, with style sheets and with themes)

To understand History Management better, we have a separate project focussing on just that.
