= Chapter 15 - Building MVP Applications =

We look in the book at how to build applications based on MVP (and what we mean by MVP).  In particular we cover:

 * Hand built MVP
 * Using GWT's Activity and Place
 * Code splitting in an MVP world
 * How Editors and Data Presentation widgets fit with MVP

This discussion is supported by 4 versions of a Photo application.
