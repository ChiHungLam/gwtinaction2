We look at the following aspects:

  * Static internationalization (i18n)
  * Dynamic i18n
  * Localization of times, dates, currency and number formats
  * localization of client bundles
  * Alternative messages drive by plurality and user defined conditions
  * How we also need to be aware of cross site hack attacks when using i18N and how to protect against them

We also look at how to use !DirectionEstimators to guess if someone is using a left-right language or a right-left one.
