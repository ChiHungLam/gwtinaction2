= Chapter 2 - Building a GWT application: Saying Hello World =

The emphasis of chapter 2 is on you using the GWT tools (specifically the Google Plugin for Eclipse) to create a basic GWT application.

<g:plusone></g:plusone>

We look at what is created, why, and how.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

We examine the process for the following:

 * Dev mode
 * Super Dev Mode
 * GWT Compiler
 * Bootstrapping process
 * Application structure
 * Difference between Java packages and GWT modules

== Super Dev Mode in GWT 2.5 ==
Super Dev Mode is new with GWT 2.5.  It is very experimental but the future of GWT by slipping loose from the need of a browser plugin.  However, for now, it is not widely supported - here it is in action in Chrome...

...where you can see we can debug our Java source directly in the browser's web development tool!
